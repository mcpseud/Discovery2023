    "In Lecture 3 we learned about how resistance spreads. Fundamentally the main driver of resistance is \n",
    "antimicrobial usage â€“ if we didn't use antimicrobials at all then resistance would not be spreading. However, antimicrobial usage is essential for treating and preventing infections, so we need to devise clever strategies to minimise the speed of spread of antimicrobial resistance while continuing to use them. In this workshop you will try to design a strategy of this sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the workshop you will run a pre-coded computer model of the spread of antimicrobial resistance in a hospital. This model captures the scenario we discussed in Lecture 3 of the spread of both antimicrobial resistant and antimicrobial susceptible bacteria. Working in groups you will decide on a strategy for which antimicrobials should be deployed where in the hospital based on information available to you on current levels of resistance in the hospital. You will learn how to code this as a function in Python and test if it helps reduce deaths in the hospital compared to baseline antimicrobial usage practices.\n",

However, you do not simply have to rely on functions from the In Python you can create a function using the word `def`. Let's look at a simple example to beign.\n"
